Quick install guide
===================

Requirements
------------
hub.js should run on any `ECMAScript 3`_-compliant JavaScript engine. If you 
have found a compliant JavaScript engine that will not run hub.js, `please 
submit a bug report`_. Portability issues are high priority and will be 
addressed promptly.

hub.js is a standalone library, not a "framework". It contains no tooling, no 
"buildtools", no dependencies of any kind. It does not have its own package 
manager or server. Everything is contained in a single file.

We firmly believe that your app's model layer should be as portable as possible 
to new platforms. The design of hub.js makes this possible: hub.js makes no 
assumptions about the environment that it is run in. This makes hub.js (and the 
data models you build on top of it) extremely portable.

hub.js is released under a liberal `MIT license`_.

Getting the code
----------------

Before you can use hub.js, you'll need to get a copy for yourself. There are 
`two copies of hub.js available`_. The first, called 'hub-VERSION.js' is 
for development only and includes copius amounts of inline documentation and 
readable source code. ('VERSION' is a placeholder for the current release of 
hub.js. For example, 'hub-0.9.js'.)

The second is called 'hub-VERSION.min.js' and is meant for deployment. All of 
the comments have been removed and the source code packed and minified. This 
makes the source code virtually unreadable, but reduces the size dramatically.

hub.js is self-contained, so you can place it anywhere on your system. A 
typical location is next to the HTML file you intend to load hub.js into. You 
can then refrerence hub.js like this:

.. code-block:: html

    <script type="text/javascript" src="hub-VERSION.js"></script>

.. admonition:: Don't link!

    Please do not link to http://hubjs.org/download/hub-VERSION.js! Always get 
    your own copy.
    
    Long-term, we hope to have hub.js available via Google's CDN. If you know 
    someone at Google who can help get that done, please `send Erich Ocean a 
    message via GitHub`_.

That's it!
