This repo holds the source required to build the hub.js documentation. 

HubJS can be found here:
http://github.com/hubjs/hubjs

One day these docs will all be hub based, but for now we are using the django templates. To view the docs you will need to compile them. Here's how to do it:

For Ubuntu:

sudo apt-get install python-sphinx
make html
firefox _build/html/index.html
